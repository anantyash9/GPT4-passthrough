# UnlimitedGPT Documentation

A Python library made for interacting with ChatGPT.

# Getting started
Make sure you install [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) before using this library, as it uses `undetected_chromedriver` to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot protection, which requires Chrome/Chromium to be installed. 

# Installation

You can install the library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/UnlimitedGPT/) using the following command:

### Normal Operating Systems
```sh
# Windows
pip install UnlimitedGPT -U

# Linux/macOS
pip3 install UnlimitedGPT -U
```

### Headless Linux Servers
```sh
# install chromium & X virtual framebuffer
sudo apt install chromium-browser xvfb
pip3 install UnlimitedGPT -U
```

### Google Colab
```sh
# install dependencies
!apt install chromium-browser xvfb
!pip install -U selenium_profiles UnlimitedGPT
```
```py
# install chromedriver
from selenium_profiles.utils.installer import install_chromedriver
install_chromedriver()
```

# Initialization

Create an instance of `ChatGPT`:
```py
from UnlimitedGPT import ChatGPT

session_token = "YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
conversation_id = "YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID"

chatbot = ChatGPT(
    session_token,
    conversation_id=conversation_id,
    proxy=None,
    chrome_args=None,
    disable_moderation=False,
    verbose=False,
)
```

You can also select from different models:
```py
chatbot = ChatGPT(
    session_token,
    model=2 # <- Change this
)
```

Available Models:

- (0) Default
- (1) GPT-3.5 Turbo
- (2) GPT-4 (Attachments Available)
- (3) GPT-4 Code Interpreter (Attachments Available)
- (4) GPT-4 Plugins
- (5) GPT-4 DALL-E

If using a previously-initiated conversation, set model to 0

If using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), set `clipboard_retrival` to `False`:

```py
chatbot = ChatGPT(
    session_token,
    clipboard_retrival=False
)
```

# Parameters

- `session_token (str)`: The `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` cookie from https://chat.openai.com/chat.
- `conversation_id (Optional[int])`: The conversation ID. Defaults to `None`.
    - To obtain a conversation ID, click on any conversation, then take the part of the URL that comes after `https://chat.openai.com/c/`
        - Example: The conversation ID in the URL `https://chat.openai.com/c/aa4f2349-8090-42a8-b8dc-0d116ce6b712` is `aa4f2349-8090-42a8-b8dc-0d116ce6b712`.
- `proxy (Optional[str])`: The proxy to use. Defaults to `None`.
- `disable_moderation (bool)`: Whether to disable moderation or not. Defaults to `False`.
- `verbose (bool)`: Whether to print debug messages or not. Defaults to `False`.
- `headless (bool)`: Whether to run Chrome in headless mode or not. Defaults to `True`.
- `chrome_args: (list)`: The Chrome arguments to use. Defaults to `[]`.

# Obtaining the session token

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com/chat and open the developer tools by `F12`.
2. Find the `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` cookie in `Application` > `Storage` > `Cookies` > `https://chat.openai.com`.
3. Copy the value in the `Cookie Value` field.

# Methods
There are 2 types of methods in this library:
1. [Methods responsible for interacting with the ChatGPT website.](#chatgpt-website-methods)
2. [Methods responsible for interacting with the backend API.](#backend-api-methods)

## ChatGPT Website Methods

### Remember to initialize the class first!
```py
from UnlimitedGPT import ChatGPT
api = ChatGPT(...)
```
### Sending a message
```py
message = api.send_message(
    "Hey ChatGPT!",
    input_mode="INSTANT", # Can be INSTANT or SLOW
    input_delay=0.1, # Only used when input_mode is set to SLOW
)
print(message.response, message.conversation_id)
```
### Sending a message with an Image/File
Note: Attachments **ONLY** work with GPT-4 `(2)` and GPT-4 Code Interpreter `(3)`
```py
message = api.send_message(
    message="Describe this picture",
    attachment="/home/user/image.jpg"
)
print(message.response)
```
### Regenrating a response
```py
message = api.regenerate_response(
    message_timeout=240, # Time to wait for the message to regenerate before timing out.
    click_timeout=20, #  Time to wait for the button to be clicked before timing out.
) # Regenerates the last response sent by ChatGPT
print(message.response, message.conversation_id)
```
### Resetting the conversation
```py
api.reset_conversation()
```
### Switching to a new conversation
```py
api.switch_conversation("NEW_CONVERSATION_ID") # Make sure it's valid or InvalidConversationID exception will be raised
```
### Clearing all conversations
```py
api.clear_conversations()
```
### Switching themes
```py
api.switch_theme("DARK") # DARK, LIGHT, SYSTEM, OPPOSITE
```
### Getting session data
```py
data = api.get_session_data() # Returns SessionData object with some data, also User object inside of it
print(repr(data), repr(data.user))
```
### Toggling the chat history on/off
```py
api.toggle_chat_history(state=False) # If set to True, it enables it
```
### Logging out
```py
api.logout()
```
### Switching accounts
```py
data = api.switch_account("some-other-token") # Returns SessionData object with some data, also User object inside of it
print(repr(data), repr(data.user))
```

## Backend API Methods

### Remember to initialize the class first!
```py
from UnlimitedGPT import ChatGPT
api = ChatGPT(...)
```
### Getting user data
```py
accounts = api.get_user_data()
# There is way too many children and nested children to include
# This function returns a Accounts objects that is rich with data
```
### Getting conversations
```py
data = api.get_conversations() # Returns Conversations object
for conversation in data.conversations: # conversaion is of type Conversation
    print(
        conversation.name, # The name of the conversation
        conversation.conversation_id, # The conversation ID
        conversation.create_time # The time the conversation was created
    )
```
### Getting shared conversations
```py
data = api.get_shared_conversations() # Returns Conversations object
for conversation in data.shared_conversations: # conversaion is of type Conversation
    print(
        conversation.tutle, # The title of the conversation
        conversation.id, # The shared conversation ID
        conversation.conversation_id, # The conversation ID
        conversation.create_time # The time the conversation was created
        conversation.update_time # The time the conversation was updated
        # and more!
    )
```

- How do I report a bug?
    - You can report a bug by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/Sxvxgee/UnlimitedGPT/issues). Please make sure that you are using the latest version of the library before reporting a bug. Also, please make sure that the bug you are reporting has not been reported before.

- Is this project affiliated with OpenAI?
    - No, this project is not affiliated with OpenAI in any way.

- Why I can't send an attachment to GPT-3, GPT-4 Plugins, or GPT-4 DALL-E?
    - None of these modalities support attachments, they are only available in GPT-4 and GPT-4 Code Interpreter.

- I am getting "Unusual activity" when giving GPT-4 an image...
    - Try setting `input_mode` to `SLOW`

- Is this project safe to use?
    - Yes, this project is safe to use. However, if you are using this project to automate your conversations on https://chat.openai.com/chat, you might get banned. So, use this project at your own risk, as it is against the OpenAI's TOS.
